# Wayfarer PRD

Requirements are written as testable statements with stable IDs. Each requirement is
implemented by one primitive's slice (see `docs/adr/` for the design decisions behind
each slice, and GitHub issue #13 for the parent build spec).

## REQ-RUNTIME-001 — Concierge deployed to AgentCore Runtime, invocable end to end

The Concierge handler is deployed to AgentCore Runtime (Node.js direct code deployment,
`BedrockAgentCoreApp`) and answers a Caller message with a model-generated reply through
the real entry point (`/invocations`), with a passing `/ping` health check.

Source: issue #14, acceptance criterion 1.

## REQ-RUNTIME-002 — Runtime sessions are isolated

Two Runtime sessions, identified by distinct `runtimeSessionId`s, never observe each
other's conversation state. A message recorded under session A is invisible to session B.

Source: issue #14, acceptance criterion 2.

## REQ-RUNTIME-003 — Composition root wires real adapters

The Concierge's entry point is assembled at a single composition root from real adapters
(model client, conversation repository) implementing usecase-owned ports. No service
locators; no `new` for a collaborator inside usecase or domain code.

Source: issue #14, acceptance criterion 3.

## Changelog

- 2026-08-28 — Added REQ-RUNTIME-001, REQ-RUNTIME-002, REQ-RUNTIME-003 for the Runtime
  walking skeleton (issue #14). First requirements in this PRD.
